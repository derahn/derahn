### So what else do i do apart from the obvious??
Well, for one video games. Yes my love for art just makes me fascinated with the scenary and overall composition of some of th eAAA gaming titles out there.
I also love to read, well if visiting codepen or stackoverflow and seeing how people do things qualifies as that anyways.
I also love soccer, basketball and yes, coding.

With me, nothing beats a perfect design which is well interpreted. Why dont you say HI! You can reach me on **aboabaoladotun** @ **gmail.com**.
